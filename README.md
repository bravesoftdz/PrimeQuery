# PrimeQuery
This started out as a simple Windows phone app to test to see if a number was prime or not. 
Using Oxygene in Visual Studio, it grew into a challenge to see how many different environments
this simple app could be ported to. At first, the main class was simply copied to each new platform,
but then RemObjects added the concept of a Shared Project and this code was branched.

Development on this branch has ceased and moved to the "shared_class".
